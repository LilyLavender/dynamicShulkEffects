# dynamicShulkEffects
Source code for the Dynamic Shulk Effects Mod

To get a basic understanding of how the mod works, watch episode 42 of mod workshop and look over [the code](https://github.com/LilyLavender/smashline-tutorial/blob/main/episode42/example2.rs) of it. (More context might be needed with episodes [25](https://github.com/LilyLavender/smashline-tutorial/blob/main/episode25/mod.rs) and [28](https://github.com/LilyLavender/smashline-tutorial/blob/main/episode28/mod.rs))
