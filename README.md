Source code for the Dynamic Shulk Effects Mod

**I wouldn't recommend using this repo to see how the mod was made**, as it's super optimized and may be hard to read.
Feel free to look through for some of the more complicated parts, but **to get a basic understanding of how the mod works,
watch episode 42 of mod workshop** and look over [the code](https://github.com/LilyLavender/smashline-tutorial/blob/main/episode42/example2.rs) of it. (More context might be needed with episodes [25](https://github.com/LilyLavender/smashline-tutorial/blob/main/episode25/mod.rs) and [28](https://github.com/LilyLavender/smashline-tutorial/blob/main/episode28/mod.rs))
